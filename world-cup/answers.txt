Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?:

The smaller simulations didn't include all of the teams which could be considered incorrect

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?:

The predictions stabalize after 10000 rounds without costing a large amount of time. I would stop at 10000
