# CS50
This repository is to showcase the work I've completed for CS50. Over the span of 5 weeks, I completed all labs and problem sets and am currently working on my final project. I've learned many languages, from Python to C to HTML and Javascript, and critical computer science concepts like data structures (tries, graphs, linked lists, hash tables) and algorithms (bubble sort, binary search). This repository is just a place to present some of the stuff I've learned and some of the programs I'm proud of.
